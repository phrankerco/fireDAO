<h2>What is fireDAO?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>fireDAO is the next phase of the $FIRE Token Project. From the beginning, the $FIRE Token Project has been part meme coin, part community (All FIRE!) and this is a way for the Community to come together and drive the project - and the fireDAO itself. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have two simple visions:  <br>1. Community!<br>2. Support wildfire prevention and  fight wildfiresThe main objective is to provide a governance framework where members of the DAO (holders of a fireDAO NFT) will be the only members allowed to propose  and vote on project proposals). Think of it as your membership badge. </p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Similar to other DAOs on Cardano and other blockchains, there will be a fixed supply of membership NFTS minted that provide holders certain privileges. All of these privileges are still to be determined, but will include proposing items to the team and subsequently voting on project proposals. We will use our Discord community server to facilitate all governance actions. As DAOs are still WIP tools, the formal definition does not necessarily apply in every case. Actually, most DAOs, even on Ethereum where they are most developed, donâ€™t have most rules encoded in a smart contract at this time. So some trust (in the project team) is still needed, as well as the use of off-chain tools to facilitate governance actions.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, governance actions will take place in Discord where we will use the existing HAZELnet Discord Bot to assign Discord roles to verified NFT holders which will grant permission to #channels not only for discussion, but also for a structured way of proposing project/DAO initiatives and then also voting on those proposals. </p>

<h2>Membership NFTs</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There will be a fixed supply of 500 fireDAO NFTs minted (mint date/time TBA). These will be minted in three phases. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>50 <strong><em>Genesis</em> - <em>Phase 0</em></strong> NFTs (2 variants)</li><li>150 <em><strong>Member - Phase 1</strong></em> NFTs (4 variants)</li><li>300 <em><strong>Member - Phase 2</strong></em> NFTs (4 variants) </li></ul>
